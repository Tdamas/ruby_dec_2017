To run your first ruby code
start your vagrant machine by running the following command:
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
touch first_ruby_file.rb

open the file in your terminal. Copy this code into the file:
// Ruby code
arr = ["I", "code", "therefore", "I", "am"]
for i in 0...arr.count
  puts arr[i]
end

// Javascript equivalent
# var arr = ["Ruby", "Is", "Life"];
# for(var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
#     console.log(arr[i]);
# }

$ ruby first_ruby_file.rb  // Type this command to see your output:
I
